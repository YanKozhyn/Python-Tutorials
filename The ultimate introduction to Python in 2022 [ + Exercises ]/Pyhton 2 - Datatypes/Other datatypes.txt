Python is incredibly flexible with datatypes
Sometimes data is converted automatically(int + float)

Functions to change datatypes
int(), float(), str(), bool(), list(), dict(), tuple(), set() 
these are very forgiving


There are lots of datatypes you don't explicitly use
None - Absence of a value
sequence - To get a range of numbers

Bytes, complex numbers, memoryview, frozensets - more specific types
or data you will see for highly specific purposes
