So far we always executed code from start to finish

But sometimes that is not desirable:
Only run code if a condition is True
Run code multiple times
Run code for every item in a list

Python has lots of ways to control the flow of the code

But to understand how that workds we need 
to understand how Python groups chunks of code
We use indentation

If condition is True run: 
	Line 1
	Line 2 } indents determine that the code belongs to the if statement
	Line 3

Line4
Line5 } Lines that are not indented don't belong to the if statement
Line6 


There are 4 major ways that detemine the flow of the code
if elif else - run code if conditions are true
Match - if statements for more specific values
While - Repeat code as long as condition is true
For - Run code for every item in a container. e.x.: [1,2,3]

There are also commands like break or next to have even more control
