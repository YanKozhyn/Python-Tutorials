So far 
we covered some datatypes (int,string,lists,bools)
And how to change them with functions and methods
We also covered how to change the flow of the code
(if + eles, match, while,for)

This is a good start but it only gets us so far

The tools we learned about so far are coparable to the basic parts
required for a car like screws, pipes, wires, plastics ext

However, we don't build a car out of these parts
Engine, Battery, control....

What that means is that we want to combine
the simple tools into more complex parts
and for that, we start with functions

A function is simply a block of code
that can be reused

1. We create the function, this is where all the code is added
2. We call the function, this executes the code created in step 1
A function can be called multiple times and we can even customise it
when we call it
